Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).
*/

// Add rooms here
var rooms = {
	room1: {
		name: 'room1',
		description: 'test',
		completed: true,
	},
	room2: {
		name: 'room2',
		description: 'test',
		completed: true,
	},
	room3: {
		name: 'room3',
		description: 'test',
		completed: true,
	},
};
